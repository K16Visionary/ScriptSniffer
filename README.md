Project Overview

Welcome to the ScriptSniffer repository! This project is designed to efficiently search and analyze PDF documents containing a blend of English, Telugu, and Urdu languages. Leveraging the power of Python, we've integrated a suite of powerful libraries including PIL (Pillow), pytesseract, os, langdetect, and fitz (PyMuPDF). PIL facilitates image processing, pytesseract handles Optical Character Recognition (OCR), os manages file paths, langdetect detects language, and fitz is employed for comprehensive PDF handling. Our goal is to provide a seamless solution for users to navigate and extract valuable insights from multilingual PDFs. Explore the project, contribute, and enhance your language processing workflows with ScriptSniffer.
